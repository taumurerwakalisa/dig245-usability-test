                    <h4>What is a usability test?</h4>
         <!--Include what tasks are in this description or add a methodology part-->
                         <p>A usability test is a method that is used to check how user-friendly and easy to use a website is.</p>
                         <p>This test invloves giving a user 5 realistic tasks to complete on the goodreads website while observing and making
                            comments on their interactions.
                         </p>

                         <p>In this test, we also note down how long it took the user to accomplish each task.</p>
                    <h4>What is Goodreads.com?</h4>
                    <p>Goodreads is a website owned by Amazon.com, that allows users to get book 
                    recommendations, rate and review books, and engage with a community of readers. </p>

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-7">
                <h4>TASK 1: MAKE AN ACCOUNT/SIGN IN</h4>
                <p>Our first task was for the user to go to the website and sign in or make an account (for first time users).</p> 
               <p>When the user got to the website, they were quickly able to find the 'Log in' section.
                Even better, they were able to link goodreads to their Amazon account in order to sign in.</p>
                <p>Overall, this was an easy task for our user.</p>

                <h4>TASK 2: FIND YOUR FAVORITE BOOK</h4>
                <p>The second task was for the user to search for a book of their preference.</p>
                
                <p>This task was fairly easy because the search bar was not difficult to spot. The book 
                    immediately popped up when the user hit search.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-7">
                <h4>TASK 3: ADD A BOOK TO YOUR "WANT TO READ" LIST</h4>
                <p>After finding their favorite book, the user had to add it to a 'Want to read' list for future reference.</p>
                
                <p>When prompted to do so, the user immediately spotted the green 'Want to read' button next to the 
                    book and added the book to the list. </p>
                <p>Overall, this was a simple task because the button was not hard to spot.</p>

                <h4>TASK 4: JOIN READING GROUP OF INTEREST</h4>
                <p>The next task was for the user to find and join a reading group they found interesting. A reading group is where
                    readers can discuss books and share recommendations.
                </p>
                
                <p>The user easily navigated to the community tab, where they found the groups' section. However, the user faced some difficulties when trying to 
                    join one: </p>
                
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>They noticed that some groups were invite-only and there were no identifiers for which ones were or weren't.</li>
                    <li>The user had to add birthday information to join the group.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p style="font-style: italic">One recommendation for improvement would be to separate the groups into
                    invite-only and all-access groups.

                <h4>TASK 5: LIKE SOMEONE'S POST</h4>
                <p>This task required the user to like a post made by another goodreads user.</p>
                
                <p>When looking for posts to like, the user was not sure of which ones were likeable i.e. book reviews, profile posts, or comments?</p>
                <p>Another issue arose when the user could not find a like button, but eventually did, after some time perusing the page.</p>
                <p>After all the trouble with finding a like button, the user made a comment about how the page looked cluttered, indicating an unpleasant design.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Goodreads had some issues affecting its ease of use; </p>
             <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, it is difficult to identify the option to like someone’s post.</li> 
                    <li>Finding a reading group is easy. However, there are still more steps to complete before actually joining one e.g. adding your birthday info.</li>
                    <li>A user is not able to distinguish which groups are invite-only or all-access.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Generally, the website can be navigated easily, even though there are some minor issues that need 
            to be improved like the ones mentioned above and the way items are arranged to avoid clutter on some of the pages.</p>
